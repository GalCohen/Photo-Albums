Photo-Albums
============

A Photo Albums application in Java. Partner Project for CS213 Spring 2012 Rutgers. Manage photos, albums, sort by tags and date, and more.

The purpose of this project was to gain experience with the techniques necessary for large scale software development. This included:
- Mandatory pre-coding Design Stage, including UML diagrams.
- Modular design
- MVC Design pattern
- Thoroughly documented code & generated docs
- version control (Mercurial at the time)

Other things that were done to enforce modularity and good design included having us make different swappable Models, View and Controller pieces such as
writing a text based interface, which was later replaced by a GUI in java, and later again with an Android App.
